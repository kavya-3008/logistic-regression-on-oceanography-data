# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook `Untitled-1.ipynb`, which showcases the application of logistic regression on standardized and normalized datasets to predict temperature categories. The project includes detailed analyses comparing the accuracy of predictions across different preprocessing techniques.

## Project Structure
- `Untitled-1.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the logistic regression model and comparative analysis.
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets used in the project.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation and notes related to the project.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing logistic regression and preprocessing techniques.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and presentations.

## Features
- **Logistic Regression**: Application of logistic regression to predict temperature based on different data preprocessing methods:
  - **Standardization**: Data is rescaled to have zero mean and unit variance.
  - **Normalization**: Data is rescaled to a range of 0 to 1.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluation and comparison of model accuracy using standardized versus normalized data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Detailed steps for standardizing and normalizing data.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and plots to illustrate the impact of data preprocessing on prediction accuracy.



## Usage
Navigate through the notebook `Untitled-1.ipynb` for a step-by-step guide on preparing data, applying logistic regression, and comparing the effects of different preprocessing techniques on model performance.
